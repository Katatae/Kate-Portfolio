             <h2>Hello! My name is Kate and I am taking Art and Design here at San Jac. I love to be creative through drawing,
            and photography. I love to make art that helps me be expressive in any form, I always have so much to say so it's easier to say it through art. 
            My favorite part of the process is seeing my ideas come to life and getting feedback on my work. It's a bonus if people connect with it as well. </h2>
